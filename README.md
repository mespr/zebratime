# Zebra Time
zulu time for humans. UTC we can read and speak.

The time of day means both where the sun is relative to you,
and a moment in the progression of time. We use the same notation
for both, HH:MM:SS. With a trailing Z you indicate Zulu time. But
our increasingly global world could use a more distinctive format.

Zebra time replaces the hour with a letter. 02:00Z becomes B:00.
