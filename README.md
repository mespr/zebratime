# Zebra Time
is Zulu time for humans; UTC we can read and speak.

'Time' means both where the sun is relative to you - which is your 
local time, and a moment in the progression of time - UTC, the 
Coordinated Universal Time, or "Zulu Time" in navigation. It is 
always the same moment, the same Zulu Time, all around the world, 
based on the events that have happened vs. those still to come.  

Two completely distinct meanings, yet we use the same language 
for both, HH:MM:SS, with trailing letters to indicate whether it 
is the local time of day- where the sun is now at that locale, 
like 4:00 o'clock Eastern Standard Time, or with a Z or UTC or 
GMT to indicate we are talking about the 0 hundred hours moment 
in time. 

Our increasingly global world needs to keep these two notions 
distinct in people's minds, by using different notations: 

Zebra Time replaces the o'clock with 'hours', just like Zulu 
time does. It a;sp replaces the hour number with a _letter_. 
02:00 hours Z becomes B:00 hours, while the time of day might 
be any time, depending on where you are at B:00 hours. 

This project provides the software for an easier way to relate 
and manipulate both kinds of time, or both people and computers.
